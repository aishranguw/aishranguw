# Hi there, I'm Aishwarya 👋  

I build AI-native products, intelligent agents, and clean, scalable workflows that simplify complex enterprise processes. My work sits at the intersection of **AI**, **product strategy**, and **enterprise systems** — from verticalizing SAP Cloud ERP to building 0→1 AI agents for real users.

I like solving messy problems with clarity, structure, and fast, thoughtful execution.
